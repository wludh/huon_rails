                    <note xml:id="t1.2" type="biblio" resp="#LZM">Also transcribed by Holtus (2001), pp. 48-50, lines 1-109; Pasinus, 1-10; Peyron 1-16; Graf (1878) 1-72.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t4" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM">Rajna here places a description of the miniature: Min. 1. un re (tutto army) e p..t... altre figure; non intendo bene l'imagin/ Yug. dirige un psonag/ porge un breve/ ad un altro ch 'è/ inginocchiato/ forse l'invito di uon a corte </note>
                    <note xml:id="t5" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM">Numbers in Rajna's notebook are in pencil, added later.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t7" type="codic" resp="#LZM">Rajna: 2r. The manuscript began on a recto when he saw it, with 6 lines: 4 followed by a miniature, with two more following it. Here is the beginning of today's MS.</note>
                    <!-- 7 needs to be characterized also by Rajna -->
                    <note xml:id="t10" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM">In Rajna's transcription, "y." somewhat after "el" above the line.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t22" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM">Rajna notes "sic" after <hi rend="italic">vevole</hi>.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t23" type="edit" resp="#LZM">Holtus: los. "y" crossed out; Rajna: "caratt. più picc / forte aggiunte fatte / poi –i =" (marginal note).
                    <note xml:id="t45" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna, note in right margin (sic). B: <hi rend="italic">Anchois le haete la giant d[e] la [con]trie.</hi> T seems to be missing the verb, "odia"; an emeded reading might be <hi rend="italic">anzo li (odi)a la zente de la contrà.</hi></note>
                    <note xml:id="t63" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna note: "prima saa e così / parrebbe ancora / non credo scri tr /volz corregg".</hi></note>
                    <note xml:id="t66" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna reverses these two lines, and uses numbering in the left margin to make clear their order.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t76" type="ling" resp="#LZM"> Crusca: al dilungo, vol. 1. https://books.google.com/books?id=qSoOZlKIdsgC&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=al+dilungo&source=bl&ots=SOFSiXoZ_x&sig=-sU48ACMCjMR2ymV8bcEdk_0MgI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiB99m0iYzWAhXi64MKHdn7Bx4Q6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&q=al%20dilungo&f=false</note>
                    <note xml:id="t93" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna, note "no del solito inchiostro / più nero delle giunte." At the beginning of his transcription, Rajna comments more on the various details of handwriting than toward the end.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t102" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna: seneschalcho, with the first "e" changed into "i" with a dot above and filled in. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t109" type="biblio" resp="#LZM"> End of Holtus (2001) transcription.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t110" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna's notebook has "V" in the left margin, together with a crossed-out label, "IV."</note>
                    <note xml:id="t120" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna omits this line and later inserts in the right margin, thus beginning the line numbers of his transcription being off from the total. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t123" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna: messy note here, running over beginning of the following line: "O e in? / (non) mi pare" after having crossed out "Em?"; the "non" is written after, squeezed in; he clearly was not sure. The "E" covers the beginning of "Charlo" below.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t124" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM">This line omitted in Rajna initially, inserted in right margin according to signal similar to "F." MS: ācorte, at the beginning of the line.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t125" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> <hi rend="italic">prendea</hi>: the "e" is not clearly formed, missing the loop. However, here as elsewhere, if there is not a dot for the "i" I presume that it is an "e": thanks to M. Scattolini for this tip.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t194" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM">Rajna: zos, with a mark in the margin; note on left side, referring to that mark: "qui un (a) lett. cancellz/ e sopra scritto un e, a.i./ Si dice legittima, legg. zosa." He has an "a" crossed out in the right margin.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t196" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> MS: baldovĩo; Rajna: baldovij, with a note in the left margin, "corr. in baldovĩo a.i." </note>
                    <note xml:id="t199" type="ling" resp="#LZM"> It is difficult to make sense of this line; I'm interpreting "each of them knocked his own down thoroughly," which requires understanding "le sovo" for MS: le sono (the parenthesis are for the emendation). However "n" and "v" are frequently difficult to distinguish; cf. Holtus 1985, p. XXXV. </note>
                    <!-- needs second classification here too, codicological-->
                    <note xml:id="t206" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna initially misses this line and inserts it afterward in the margin. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t219" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> There are a couple of ways that this could be interpreted: first, "le roi... / armé, et avec toutes ses armes décorées d'une fleur de lys"; or, "[the king] is armed in weapons all decorated with a fleur-de-lys"; that is, the second word of the line could be a verb or the conjunction.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t221" type="ling" resp="#LZM"> <hi rend="italic">elziso</hi>: this form seems to be from <hi rend="italic">alzire/elzire</hi>; cf. <hi rend="italic"Aquilon de Bavière</hi>, "to kill"; the line then means, "that is, Huon, who wouldn't have killed him [Berardo] at all." Compare to B, where the verb is "to hate."</note>
                    <note xml:id="t240" type="ling" resp="#LZM">This line does not make sense, since the copyist didn't understand the type of horse, "amoravis" and changed the term to something he knew! Compare with B. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t243" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna's copy shows a spot above "quelo," but it does not seem to be a dot to an "i" merely an imperfection in the paper. </note
                    <note xml:id="t246" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> Illumination follows: Rajna, "2 giostra." In fact there is a view of one horsed man from the front, with a crown on his head and a sun on his chest in the center of the page; behind, to the right, there is a side view of a figure in grey on horseback with his lance at the attack position, with the same sun motif on the horse's caparison and a cape visible on his back. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t263" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna initially omits this line and adds it in the margin afterwards. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t302" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> B: selong lor coi[n]tenance. Nowhere else in this MS does any such form "sealonga" appear. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t306" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna initially skips this line and adds it later in the left margin. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t313" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna note: "li lom o loim, non /loin; ma / il segno sopra non / è un i troppo/ legittimo, ma rro/ poi (mi pare) un segno / p l'asta sotta / posta – se è / fu mal fatto."</note>
                    <note xml:id="t330" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna, note in margin: (sir, voglio) </note>
                    <note xml:id="t356" type="ling" resp="#LZM"> "a dove a dove"= <hi rend="italic">a due a due</hi>; cf. "sove" = <hi rend="italic">sue</hi></note>
                    <note xml:id="t363" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> This line and the following are initially incorrectly ordered in Rajna, who then writes numbers in the left margin to indicate the correct order. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t380" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> <hi rend="italic">sorprisse</hi>: there is a dot above the second "r," not above the following vowel.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t413" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna notes that he is not sure whether the MS reads "in" or "m." The strokes are linked. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t417" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> Illumination: two men under tree, one with horns and bells, the other with hat over his eyes. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t418" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> The MS has been scratched: ve:y is what the MS looks like. B: Quant vos forma (l. 421) </note>
                    <note xml:id="t436" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna has a mark after "chy" and before "ßve" that is unclear; it looks like a little caret. Perhaps this should read "ss[er]ve"? </note>
                    <note xml:id="t438" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna omits the "o" of "yo." </note>
                    <note xml:id="t440" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> There seems to be a line missing here; cf. B 444: Non ai ge soingn fors tout soul de celli (between this line and the following).</note>
                    <note xml:id="t443" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna omits the "u" of "nuy." These two omissions make one wonder about the "y" in line 444—should it be "yo"? </note>
                    <note xml:id="t458" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> MS: chre da more in B reads <hi rend="italic">qui n'iert d'amore</hi> </note>
                    <note xml:id="t459" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna transcribes in reverse order this and the following line; he numbers in left margin to indicate the need to reorder. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t463" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna: ne piga. He underlines the word and has a line under the "p"; would seem to have been uncertain himself of the reading. B: emplie. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t476" type="biblio" resp="#LZM"> Cf. Dante and the pilgrim's expressions of shame: e.g., Inf. 17.85-90.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t478" type="ling" resp="#LZM"> For "se tene y[n]tra ello" B: si tient traïe </note>
                    <note xml:id="t484" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> After the second "pensery," Rajna notes (sic). </note>
                    <note xml:id="t485" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna: <hi rend="italic">anyda parla</hi> </note>
                    <note xml:id="t514" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna initially omits this line, then inserts it in the left margin.</note>
                    <note xml:id="t520" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna has a number of marks above this line that appear to be abbreviations: "razŷ...tōrmenta."</note>
                    <note xml:id="t525" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna initially omits this line, then inserts it in the left margin. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t544" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> B 549: Ja estes sire, et tot a vos atent </note>
                    <note xml:id="t569" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> The second half of this line is problematic; the hemistich reads in B: "Oïl, mon bon segnor." </note>
                    <note xml:id="t623" type="codic" resp="#LZM"> <hi rend="italic">savye</hi>: where the ink is worn, it is frequently difficult to see the tail below the line; this could well read savie. However, under the light the tail can be seen. Here the tail is only visible with the ultraviolet light. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t624" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna reverses this line and the following, noting the correct order in the left margin. </note>
                    <note xml:id="t652" type="Rajna" resp="#LZM"> Rajna reads "guer" but the MS clearly reads <hi rend="italic">a sapiate</hi> just at the edge of the burned portion. </note>
